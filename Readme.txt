AeminiumGPU Compiler

This is a Java Source to Source compiler that located special lambda functions and translates
them to OpenCL. The generated code will be able to be automatically executed on the GPU by the
AeminiumGPU runtime (http://github.com/AEminium/AeminiumGPU/), where the API is defined.
The compiler uses the Spoon Compiler Toolkit (http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/).

This is part of the Ã†minium Project (http://aeminium.dei.uc.pt)
